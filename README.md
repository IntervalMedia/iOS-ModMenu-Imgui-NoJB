## Komaru ModMenu Temp  
I did **NOT** write a majority of this.  
Made for jailed/NonJB iOS devices
originally designed for ARK  
Floating menu button  
simple C-Style casts        
easily understandable  
UE4 usage examples  
  
Posted due to a lack of iOS MM templates

### Usage  
* Getting BaseAddress  
``` uintptr_t BaseAddr  =  (uintptr_t)_dyld_get_image_header(0); ```
